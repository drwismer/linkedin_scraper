# LinkedIn Job Scraper

Please don't judge me. I never thought I'd share this code, but some redditors asked for it. This scraper worked way better when LinkedIn was using infinite scrolling rather than pagination. In my most recent update of the code, I tried to build in some slow scrolling of the search results page in order to get the webpage to load the details for each job. It seemed that the soup would only include details for job postings that were visible within the webdriver for at least a second or two. This program really only serves as a jumping off point for thinking about how to build your own scraper.
